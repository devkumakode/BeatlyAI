and `fs` which is the sampling frequency of the signal.


You are free to use the language of your choice or any other tool you would like. You are provided with two
Python functions for loading and visualization of ECG signal and the corresponding wave annotation.

You are not expected to provide the perfect solution. What counts the most is your approach and design choices.
Working pipeline with a poor performance is completely sufficient, in fact, you can choose to only describe
your approach. You should think of model/algorithm suitable for this task, any pre/post-processing, evaluation
metric. You should spend no more than 2 days on this task. For a better understanding of this task check out our blog
